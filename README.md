# Choreganizer_1.0
This is a chore chart, created in Visual Studio 2019 as a Windows Forms application (C#).
My goal is to recreate this as a web app with its own database to store lists of users, tasks, groups & requirements along with a history feature.
In the finished product, all lists are to be user-defined and the history will be saved, allowing each user to build a score based on number of completed chores over time.
